##In a newly created repository, demonstrate the ability to change a file from untracked status to tracked and later unstage the file so that it becomes "untracked" again.

mkdir demo #creating a demo repo
cd demo   #untracked 
git init
echo hello>hello.txt 
git add hello.txt #staged(tracked)
git restore --staged hello.txt #untracked again
