##Create a branch and edit a file that you inherited from master branch. Make a commit in that branch. Before you commit a second time, stash it away.
##Switch to master branch and create a new branch and apply the stash in that newly created branch. Then, return to the first branch and apply the stash again, and then delete that stash entry.
